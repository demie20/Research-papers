# Research-papers

Reading and actually articulating research papers used to be a nightmarish task for me. Mostly because I was so new to this field of study that it felt perplexing. Gradually, over time, I got over it, and found some great papers to read! 


This repository will be a place for all the research papers I read and have read, adding more to the stack over time :)
